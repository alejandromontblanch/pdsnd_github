### Bikshare project
This is the bikeshare project from Udacity.
This is a line

### Description
* This project asks the user for a city: Washington, New York or Chicago.
* Then it asks the user how to filter the data: by month, day, both or none.
    * If by month, the programme asks which month.
    * If by day, the programme asks which day.
    * If both, the programme asks both month and day.
    * If none, the programme will not ask.
* The programme will then produce basic statistics based on the above choices:
    * Most popular month, day and hour.
    * Most popular departure and arrival stations.
    * Most popular departure-arrival station combo.
    * Total and average trip duration.
    * Type of users by number, gender (if available)
    * Earliest, oldest and most common year of birth (if available)
* The programme will then ask the user if (s)he wants to see the raw data.
* The programme will then ask the user if (s) wants to run the whole thing again
_This project is based on the use of functions, to shorten code_
